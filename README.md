# Images App (iOS)

## Background

Pixabay is a popular stock photo and video website that offers a vast collection of free high-quality images and videos. With over 2.4 million users and over 2.7 million images, Pixabay has become a go-to resource for creatives and individuals seeking royalty-free visual content.

## Problem Statement

Create an iOS app that enables users to search for images on Pixabay, select multiple images from the search results, scroll endlessly through search results, and view the selected images in a slideshow format.

## Proposed Solution

### Search & Select Multiple Images

Search for images using the Pixabay API, which gives you access to over 2 million images. Select as many images as you like from the search results.

### Scroll Endlessly

Scroll endlessly without a hitch thanks to automatic content retrieval, asynchronous image loading and caching.

### View Selected Images in a Slideshow

View selected images (at least 2) in a slideshow. The images change automatically every 3 seconds, or you can scroll them horizontally.

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Define the UI using Figma.
- [x] Implement the models `Hit` and `PixabayJSON`, make them decodable and write unit tests to test the decoding.
- [x] Create a `ImageGridViewController` class. Using a storyboard, Add a search bar, collection view and a toolbar to the root view controller. Add Auto Layout constraints using XCode. Connect the views to `ImageGridViewController`.
- [x] Create a Playground. Perform GET requests using Pixabay API, testing a variety of query parameters. Retrieve sample data for `q = ""` and `per_page = 20`.
- [x] Implement `ImageCache` to load images asychronously and cache them, using sample data URLs.
- [x] Implement collection view (cell registration and snapshot) to display images using `ImageCache` and sample data.
- [x] Implement `PixabayClient` to provide a method perform a specific query: `loadHits`
- [x] Implement `HitProvider` to replace sample data. The class provides the `hits` array to read and 2 methods to update the `hits` array: `loadFirstPageData` and `loadNextPageData`.
- [x] Enable search using the search bar
- [x] Enable infinite scrolling
- [x] Enable selecting and deselecting multiple images in the collection view
- [x] Add `cancel` and `done` buttons and `# image(s) selected` label to the toolbar. Make them update whenever images are selected/deselected and new search query is performed.
- [x] Implement the `ImagesViewController` to show the selected images in a slideshow (enable manual scrolling horizontally). Apply Auto Layout constraints programmatically (_used NSLayoutConstraint.activate([]) and VFL_) 
- [x] Test the application as a user, fix any bugs & monitor performance.
- [x] Add comments
- [x] Handle errors when loading `Hit` data from Pixabay

## Next Steps

- [ ] Make the app accessible (add play/pause and close buttons in `ImagesViewController`...)
- [ ] Handle errors with alert view controllers to alert users of any failures (network connection...)
- [ ] **Fix Memory usage** (Caching without any limit): limit caching capacity using `totalCostLimit` and clear cache when performing a new query.

Each step corresponds to a scroll with new images being fetched to fill and cached:

- [ ] Do not define the constants in the middle of the code (c.f. `ImageGridViewController.createLayout()`)
- [ ] Make `PixabayClient.loadHits()` better testable (using dependency injection for `URLSession`...)
- [ ] Remove duplicate code in `ImageGridViewController`
- [ ] Improve comments
